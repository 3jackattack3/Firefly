	 MegaFireflyOffset.ino

	 Each Arduino models a firefly in a firefly swarm. These "fireflies" blink an LED at a constant CYCLEDURATION,
	 And modulate their offset based on the fireflies around it. Each firefly communicates when it has
	 turned its LED on or off to the fireflies it is connected to through serial communication. Each firefly
	 takes in data from the fireflies it is connected to, and determines each of their blinking offsets.
	 Over time, the network as a whole will collapse on one offset and become synchronized like a real
	 life swarm of fireflies. 

	 The circuit:
	 A minimum of 4 arduino megas interconnected on their 3 serial ports, each with an led on pin 13
	 Each arduino should also be wired to one "Start Button" on pin 2
	 
	 Created by Jack Defay, 2016
