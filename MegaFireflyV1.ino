/*
 MegaFireflyV1.ino

 Each Arduino models a firefly in a firefly swarm. These "fireflies" blink an LED at a given frequency,
 And modulate their frequency based on the fireflies around it. Each firefly communicates when it has
 turned its LED on or off to the fireflies it is connected to through serial communication. Each firefly
 takes in data from the fireflies it is connected to, and determines each of their blinking frequencies.
 Over time, the network as a whole will collapse on one frequency and become synchronized like a real
 life swarm of fireflies. 

 The circuit:
 A minimum of 4 arduino megas interconnected on their 3 serial ports, each with an led on pin 13
 Each arduino should also be wired to one "Start Button" on pin 2
